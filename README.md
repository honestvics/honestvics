- 👋 Hi, I’m @honestvics
- 👀 I’m interested in remote customer support roles, technology, insurance, and creating engaging content for social media.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced concepts for insurance licensing and expanding my technical skills, including Git and GitHub workflows.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on customer-centric projects, remote support solutions, and creative initiatives that help solve real-world problems.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I once worked as a Roadside Assistance Operator at AAA where I helped a member from a burning car and assisted another member with their family during a snowstorm on a closed highway. Sounds like a plot from a movie I know but it was really cool!
